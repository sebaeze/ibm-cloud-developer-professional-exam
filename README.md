### Identify the concept of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)

Compute services that runs in response to events.
It's based on Apache OpenWhisk.

#### Usage

```bash
ibmcloud target -g
NS_FN=$(ibmcloud fn namespace list | tail -n 1 | cut -c1-20) && echo $NS_FN && ibmcloud fn namespace target ${NS_FN}

ibmcloud fn deploy -m manifest.yaml
```

## Identify the benefits of using containers

A container is an executable unit of software in which application code is packaged, along with its libraries and dependencies, in common ways so that it can be run anywhere, whether on a desktop, on-premises, or in the cloud.

*   Lightweight
*   Portable
*   Architecture
*   Utilization

### Docker
Docker is a software platform for building and running applications as containers.

```bash
ibmcloud plugin install container-registry
ibmcloud plugin list

ibmcloud cr namespace-add exam-dev 
ibmcloud cr namespaces | less
```

#### Push image to registry
```bash
ibmcloud cr login
docker build -t my.registry/exam-dev/helloworld:1 -f Dockerfile
docker push my.registry/exam-dev/helloworld:1
```

*   Provisioning with Performance

### IBM Cloud Block Storage
IBM Cloud(r) Block Storage is persistent, high-performance iSCSI storage that is provisioned and managed independently of compute instance

### IBM Cloud Object Storage
IBM(r) Cloud Object Storage (COS) stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations.


### Indicate the functionality involved in deploying an application on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
Red Hat OpenShift is an open source container application platform based on the Kubernetes container orchestrator. 

### Code Engine
IBM CloudÂ® Code Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform that runs your containerized workloads, including web apps, micro-services, event-driven functions, or batch jobs.

## Section 7: Managing and Running a Cloud Application ( 10% )

### Identify the concepts of an auto-scaling policy in IBM Cloud

#### Concepts
    Scale Up: Vertical scaling -> Adds resources ( CPU, memory, storage, network )    
    Scale Out: Horizontal scaling -> adds more replicas ( virtual machines, nodes, containers )
    Autoscaling -> seamless and automatic management of resources.
    *   Scale Up:   adds compute capacity when workload increases.
    *   Scale Down: remove unnecesary resources when demand goes down.
    Rules:
    *   Schedule: scale up/down based on schedule.
    *   Deman: scale based on compute demand.
    Cluster nodes autoscaler:
    *   Plugin for kubernetes cluster public service and VPC.
    *   Scales cluster nodes.
    *   Only works for cluster with public network connectivity.
    Horizontal Pods autoscaler:
    *   Scales pods based on demand and custom metrics.
    Autoscaler for VPC:
    *   Scales virtual machines
    *   Dynamically creates and deletes VMs.
    *   Scales memory and cpu on demand.
    *   Instance template: defines the details for the VM
    *   Instance group requires the template for managing a group of VMs, having the same characteristics.

#### Scale in kubernetes

Scales to fixed numbers of pods, for example: 2
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/my_deployment --replicas=2
```

Autoscale based on CPU. Min pods=2, Max pods=6
```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment/my_deployment --min=2 --max=2 --cpu-percent=75
```

#### Auto-scaler policies
    *   Instance limits defines the min and max values for instances.
    *   Schedules represented in JSON format. The following properties are required:
        - instance_min_count
        - instance_max_count
        - initial_min_instance_count
        - start_time
        - end_time

### Distinguish between IBM Cloud application and logging tools

#### Monitoring
    *   IBM Cloud monitoring: monitors health of infrastructure and services; telemetry; custom alerts and dashboards.
    *   A sysdig agent is required in order to collect data and forward outside the kubernetes cluster   

#### Observability

    *   IBM Cloud activity tracker: Records API activities into storage services, such as: Object storage.
    *   IBM Cloud platform logs
    *   IBM Cloud activiy tracker
